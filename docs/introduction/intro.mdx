Wage Protection System (WPS) is all about **salary processing** to employees of Domestic or Company Employees. Domestic employees are such as house help etc, and Company employees are those who work in some registered company/corporate.

## Prerequisites

- **Pricing Setup**: In this step you have to set some pricing and packages which customer (company or domestic) can select for WPS. This includes all the charges, VAT charges etc.
- **Master Data Setup**: In this you have to define some configurations such as banks through which employees/individuals can get their salaries.
- **Customer/Employee Onboarding**: In this step we onboard customers in our system, customer must be onboarded to use the services.

## Pricing Setup

Before onboarding a WPS Corporate, pricing package needs to be configured. So that corporate can select a suitable package in price settings tab.

### Key fields and Screen flow

1. **Tenure**: Time period within which package is applicable from its creation date. If 2 months is selected then package will be valid till 2 month after its creation.
2. **Minimum Fee**: The fee cannot be less than this amount.
3. **Standard Fee**: The actual fee of that package and not less than min fee.
4. **Employee Count**: The standard fee applicable for the given employee count.
5. **Out of Bundle charges**: If the employees are greater than the package employee count, then out of bundle fees will be applied on extra employees. e.g in case of SIF.
6. **Free count**: If 2 is selected for _SIF UPLOAD_ case, then it means in this package, 2 sif processing are free for _corporate_.
7. **Pricing Type**: For reference we have to look into Master Data setup.
8. **Screen**: `Wage Protection System > Price Settings > Add Pricing Package`

**Example**: Lets take an example like this is how a package is assigned:

- File Upload Limit: 5
- Out of Bundle Fee: 100 (If employees exceed employee count defined in package)
- SIF (Salary Information File) upload fee: 100
- Tenure: 5 months
- 1st Month: 1 **SIF** uploaded, fee is **100**
- 2nd Month: **5 SIFs**, file limit ended
- 3rd Month: 6 -> 100+100(out of bundle fee)+disrbursement fees.
- Free Count: No file upload fee till 3 files. Charges from 4th file

## WPS Employee & Corporate Onboarding

TODO: This is left blank for now, it will be filled later when we get more info

## Master Data Setup

When we do the funding in WPS using cheque or Online transfer, we need banks (corporate bank and deposit bank). These banks are configured in bank master.

1. In bank master to onboard a corporate bank, we have to create a bank with local type and make sure to add its routing code.
2. In bank master to onboard a deposit bank, we have to create a bank with local type and isDeposit checkbox check and make sure to add its routing code.

You also need to insert following lines into you `application.properties` file for Kafka to work correctly.

Remove following line:

```java title="application.properties" showLineNumbers=172
spring.kafka.bootstrap-servers=localhost:9092
```

And add following:

```java title="application.properties"
spring.kafka.bootstrap-servers=b-2.afexcruatkafkaclust.1ux2r9.c2.kafka.me-central-1.amazonaws.com:9096
spring.kafka.properties.sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.scram.ScramLoginModule required username="afex-cr-uat-msk" password="iudhw983yu2hd2dwqldk";
spring.kafka.properties.sasl.mechanism=SCRAM-SHA-512
spring.kafka.properties.security.protocol=SASL_SSL
```
